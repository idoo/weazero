# ￼CX Development - Test Job Specifications
## Project goals
This is a paid test job with the specific goal of putting together a team of developers for a medium term project - 4–6 months. The main project will be focusing on building a customer support application. However, the current project is a test job that is small enough while being meant to test your current knowledge of the stack we will be using.
The allotted time for this test job is 8 hours. You will end work at the 8 hour mark or sooner, if work is completed before this 8 hour mark. Finishing work before alloted time will be considered towards your proficiency level and increase your chances of working on this project.

## Stack & Application
On the backend, you will be using Rails & MongoDB while the frontend will be a single-page-application built on top of Bootstrap and AngularJS.
Backend will comprise of:

2 Rake tasks that will:
pull the current temperature in Boston, US, from openweathermap.org and store it in the MongoDB backend pull the current wind speed in New York, US, from openweathermap.org and store it in the MongoDB backend

2 API endpoints exposing:
temperature in Boston, US, under /api/temperature wind speed in New York, US, under /api/windspeed
bonus points will go towards authenticating calls to /api endpoints with a hardcoded password

## UI/Frontend
Actual application interface is provided as a graphical mockup in the form of a PDF file with clickable links.
